# Swapi Excersice

SWAPI Frontend Engineering Evaluation

This project was created using [Vitejs](https://vitejs.dev/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

The idea of this project was to consume [SWAPI (Star Wars API)](https://swapi.dev/) and built a UI using [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)


## Quick Notes

If you have any issues with the API like I had during the weekend with some 404 errors, you could use this [replacement](https://swapi.py4e.com/). 

You should go to the API resource file located in `src/constants/api-urls.ts` and change this constant.

```typescript
const BASE_URL = "https://swapi.dev/api";
```
